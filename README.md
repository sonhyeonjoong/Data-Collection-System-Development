# Data Collection System Development

Hello, I'm korean and junior software engineer.
I'm working at IT public enterprise and managing web-based system.

Today, there are lots of data collection systems.
And they actually take a great role in many of modern systems.
I can sure that the usage of data collection system will be permenant. 
So, I was motivated to develop data-relevant system that is usable in all extent of my life.
For this, system should not be specific but, very general for reusability. 
This system can be utilized for many people who want to develop their own data collection system.
The purpose of development is for individual people, not business.
I will develop this system with considering availability, reliability, dependability, and so on.  

Over this project, my ultimate goal is making individual much more easy to develop their own system,
even though they don't have great skill and experience.

Oh, My english language skill is not that good.. Thank you for reading it.
